on voluntariness. The goal must be democratic regional administration and a significantly lighter central administration than at present. Tasks requiring regional development and competence should be put under the responsibility of the democratic provincial administration. Sote to the finish line Regardless of where they live, citizens must be able to see a doctor quickly and at a reasonable distance. Health and well-being differences between population groups must be narrowed. Social and health services must play together better than at present. The focus must be shifted to basic services, for health promotion and to prevent problems. For this reason, social security reform must be completed. The financing of social security services must be simplified and clarified towards a single channel. In services, customers' options for choice must be increased. Information systems must be made functional and employees' time must be freed up to meet customers. One compatible social security service channel must be put into use by 2019 at the latest. FOREIGN AND SECURITY POLICY The number one goal of Finland's foreign and security policy is to maintain stability in the Nordic region and the Baltic Sea region. Finland continues an active foreign and security policy, the cornerstone of which is good relations with its neighbors, international cooperation, military non-alignment and own reinforced defense based on general conscription and the defense of the entire country. Finland is developing NATO's partnership for peace and maintain the possibility of applying for NATO membership, if the state leadership and the Finns through a referendum ever end up with a new basic solution. Defense cooperation with Sweden is being intensified. New threats, such as the fight against cyber attacks, are being invested in. As a high-tech country, Finland can develop cyber security and privacy protection into a new growth area for itself. Nordic cooperation must be intensified, for example, in Arctic policy and within the framework of the EU and the UN, especially in the promotion of human rights. In international activities and development aid, the emphasis is on building peace, human rights and the fight against major threats to humanity, climate change, poverty and food, water and energy shortages. Food security - securing adequate food for everyone - must be made the top goal of Finland's development policy. The most important task of the European Union is still strengthening peace and stability on our continent and in the world. Finland must continue its constructive, purposeful and timely influence in the EU and to take care of our national interests arising from our special circumstances. The Union must focus on the big issues, stop getting into too much detail and give Member States room to maneuver. In the EU, cooperation between member states must be practical. The jointly agreed rules must be followed. Internal security must be strengthened. The police, ambulance and rescue services must be there quickly in dangerous situations. Care must be taken regarding the prerequisites and removal of obstacles for volunteer activities such as contract fire brigades. In exceptional situations - such
Chunk 2:
bordering the Baltic Sea and the EU must jointly bear their responsibility for saving our common sea. For example, enhancing the nutrient cycle and related technical solutions will improve the condition of both the Baltic Sea and inland waters and can at the same time create new jobs in our country. People must be able to live according to their wishes and life situations, where and how they want. Construction and housing need their own standards. Regulations that make construction difficult must be gutted, both in cities and in rural areas. A national attitude movement is needed to prevent moisture and mold problems. It means better know-how and responsibility both in ordering buildings, planning, monitoring, construction itself as well as in the use of facilities. Less standards, more trust In Finland, coal blowing is needed. The safety nets of society and neighboring communities must function. In a healthy society, people are helped, people are treated fairly, they have the opportunity to participate, and citizens follow the jointly agreed rules of the game. Instead of excessive norms, Finns need more mutual trust. For necessary reforms, for improving competitiveness and to increase employment, a social contract is needed - exceptionally strong and committed cooperation between the government, parliament, labor market organizations, companies and other actors. The state needs to increase trust above all with consistent and long-term decision-making. The management system of the public sector must be reformed, starting with the work of the Government. The government's accounting practice must be changed. The public sector needs to change from a brake to an enabler - of trying and to encourage work. Unnecessary standardization must be dismantled. Clear time limits are needed for processing permits, complaints and other issues. The smoothness of public administration must be made a competitive advantage for Finland. ECONOMIC GROWTH 200,000 new jobs The vicious cycle of our economy must be broken. We need 200,000 new jobs for the private sector in ten years. It requires the creation of growth, especially for new industries such as the bio and creative economy. Our traditional industries must be renewed and strengthened. The social contract must improve the competitiveness of our companies. Taxation must encourage entrepreneurship, risk-taking and to work. Regulation that restricts activity and competition must be dismantled. The assessment of the need for labor coming from outside the EEA area must be removed. The focus of transport policy that supports business activities and citizens' everyday life must be shifted from new expensive projects to the maintenance and upkeep of roads, railways and other thoroughfares. Working careers must be extended. In addition to the pension solution we need increasingly faster graduation for working life, maintenance and rehabilitation of work ability, utilization of the skills of people who are able to work part-time and even better well-being at work. The labor market must be reformed so that, at the same time, employee safety is strengthened and more flexibility for the employer. Social security must be developed in such a way that it
Chunk 3:
is to create the conditions for people to take responsibility for themselves. For example, self-care and rehabilitation must be reformed to support people's health, coping and working. Sports and cultural services support well-being and health. Public funds must be used to support self-directed hobby opportunities that reach as many population groups as possible. For children, young people and the needy, sufficient free and affordable low-threshold cultural and sports opportunities must be ensured, including opportunities to try new hobbies. The mobility needs of the elderly must be taken care of. Finland needs national attitude talks on the use of alcohol. The costs to society caused by alcohol must be reduced. We have to move from a drunken drinking culture towards moderation. The effectiveness of substance abuse care and treatment must be improved. Time for loved ones, space for volunteer work People take responsibility for their loved ones by giving them their time and everyday help. It is invaluable not only from a human perspective, but also from the point of view of our national economy. Many Finns also work in organizations and other voluntary work. The basic conditions for this activity, especially long-term financing, must be secured. The norms and bureaucracy burdening clubs and organizations must be dismantled. Reimbursement of travel expenses and provision of food to volunteers must be allowed, for example. More and more public spaces and equipment must be made available to volunteers. The expertise of volunteers must be utilized better than at present. They need to be heard more often already in the preparation phase of things and to be involved in the renewal, planning and production of services. A clean environment for posterity Climate change must be stopped. All countries must together set the framework and rules of the game for emissions and climate efforts, and reduce fossil oil use by a third by the 2030s. The use of coal must be stopped in Finland. The carbon-free Helsinki 2025 project must be launched. The use of renewables will be increased by changing the focus of taxation and simplifying standardization. Finland must look for practical solutions to global challenges, climate change and food, water and energy shortages. Solving them will also create new jobs in the bioeconomy and clean technology companies, as well as in the food industry. Biodiversity must be protected first of all with methods based on voluntariness, such as Southern Finland's forest protection program Metso. Finland, the other countries secures a person's basic income and at the same time encourages the acceptance of work. The functionality of basic income must be tested and developed through regional experiments. We need to find ways to speed up investments and to increase the share of product development and research activities in the gross national product closer to the four percent target. Companies can be encouraged to do this by introducing an application of the undistributed profit reservation system instead of the Estonian tax model. Education and competence as a cornerstone Finland must be made a model country
Chunk 4:
processing value and marketing our products even better. The EU's food policy must ensure consumers' right to comprehensive food origin labels and product traceability. Primary producers must be guaranteed a fair share in the income distribution of the food chain. The public sector must ensure the conditions for the development of digital services. Citizens must be able to control the information stored and used by themselves and handle all official dealings electronically. A fast and affordable broadband connection must be secured for all citizens and companies. Digitization and putting information systems in order can increase the productivity of the public sector, free up workers' time to meet customers and increase work well-being. CARE Caring for relatives and caring for the elderly Caregivers take care of their loved ones who are elderly, disabled or otherwise need constant help. Currently, caregivers living in different parts of Finland are in an unequal position. The level of support varies depending on the municipality. Therefore, uniform national criteria must be drawn up for family care and the financial support of caregivers must be transferred to Kela's responsibility. Sufficient support services must also be secured for caregivers. Everyone has the right to a good and dignified old age. It includes the right to self-determination, inclusion and security. Every elderly person must receive support and services according to their needs. Family therapy must be used more and more not only for children and young people in foster care, but also for the elderly, people with intellectual disabilities, and people undergoing mental health rehabilitation. Home services and freedom of choice back to families Finland needs a family policy that is consistent and reduces inequality. Families must have genuine freedom of choice in the care solutions for their children. Forced quotas of home care for mother and father are not a viable solution. Especially for parents of young children, better opportunities for flexible working time solutions must be created. Municipal home service needs to be increased to help families in temporary difficulties. Let's improve the flow of information in the child's affairs between different actors. Adequate security is provided and competent child protection personnel. Stop the marginalization of young people One marginalized young person is too many. He will pay society 1.2 million euros during his lifetime, not to mention the human suffering. Marginalization cannot be solved with formulaic solutions such as raising the compulsory education age. A young person at risk of being marginalized needs solutions tailored just for him. A young person who has lost a place to study after primary school must ultimately be picked up from home and a suitable training or training path for working life must be drawn up for him. It is necessary to implement operating models of traveling side by side. In them, one adult takes responsibility for the overall well-being of the young person and does not push the young person from one corner to another. The call-ups of the Defense Forces must be developed into future call-ups for the

speed to the whole of Finland State property should not be sold to cover the deficit and debt of the state economy. It has to create new entrepreneurship and new jobs. Access to sufficient financing is a significant bottleneck for the growth of companies. One solution to this is a growth fund. The government's balance sheet, i.e. assets, must be better put to work. The center would use a small part, for example 1.5 billion of the state's company assets of about 30 billion, over the next 10 years to stimulate the growth of companies. The growth fund would be implemented through current operators, such as Suomen Teollisuussijoitus Oy, Finnvera Oyj, and private operators, to destinations that meet the criteria for profitable business operations, so that private money always goes ahead. However, the established players mentioned above are in dire need of new tools and better resources to finance the growth of companies. Public money should be allocated to funding bottlenecks to supplement private funding. A new instrument, Valtion Infra Oy, is needed to finance large transport projects. Growth from the bioeconomy and digitization Bioeconomy can be made into a billion-dollar success story for the whole of Finland. In addition to traditional fields, renewable natural resources can be utilized in the production of, for example, bioplastics, new types of packaging and medicines. Black carbon energy policy must be brought down by increasing domestic and renewable energy. The renewable share of the energy we use must be increased from 32 percent to more than 60 percent in the next 20 years. Wood construction must be increased and zoning to promote the use of wood also in apartment building and public construction. Finland's food imports in euros are three times compared to our exports. This food balance needs to be corrected with a billion euros by strengthening the appreciation of our clean foods, increasing the entire age group, including young women. In them, in addition to the options for completing their military service, young people can go through issues related to their future with professionals from different fields and get guidance and support for their problems. Equality for those living alone The life situations and problems of those living alone must be taken into account better than at present in decision-making. Their poverty must be prevented by taking care of basic security and supporting their employment. The needs and wishes of people living alone for affordable housing must be translated into action. In society, such payments or forms of taxation that put people living alone in an unequal position should be avoided. The maximum amount of the household deduction must be increased for those living alone. One-parent families need to be supported with flexible daycare arrangements and by developing municipal home help to support the everyday life of these families better than at present. PUBLIC FINANCE Taxation to encourage entrepreneurship and work Finns' taxation is already a world record. We can no longer tighten our overall tax rate. Taxation must be predictable,

of former combatants and support for the families of military personnel on external missions. Improve the efficiency of the Armed Forces National defense, with its main objectives guaranteeing the sovereignty of the State, national independence and the integrity of the territory as well as ensuring the freedom and security of populations and the protection of the fundamental values ​​of the constitutional order, finds an instrument in the action of the Armed Forces essential aspect of foreign policy, particularly in the context of NATO, the EU, the UN and the CPLP. The PS will seek to adapt its operations, maximizing the usefulness of available resources, channeling them to satisfy the main priorities, namely: Focusing the action of the Armed Forces on the responses defined by demanding defense planning, particularly in areas of clear added value for the country and, also, in fulfilling international commitments, in particular in participating in international peace missions; Strengthening the fight against cyberterrorism, through the Armed Forces' cybersecurity unit, especially with regard to responses to attacks on military targets, and promoting cooperation and coordination mechanisms with other services to combat cybercrime; Carrying out equipment acquisition and modernization programs in accordance with the calendar set out in the Military Programming Law; Programming, in the medium term, selective investment in appropriate equipment, especially that which translates into a multiplier effect on operational capacity, investing in joint programs and those capable of dual use (civil and military); Reorganizing the territorial device according to the identified missions and the maintenance of an effective operational capacity; Consolidating sharing mechanisms between branches, giving priority to support and logistics areas, with a view to joint use from a perspective of complementarity and rationality; Ensuring the stability of staff, after adequate planning, with regard to organic staff; Ensuring the maintenance and support of resources, within existing constraints and budgetary commitments assumed. Stimulate the Defense Industry The existence of a Defense industry is crucial for the effective autonomy and ability to fulfill the missions of the Armed Forces. On the other hand, Defense industries are, nowadays, associated with technologies with high added value, export capacity and creation of qualified jobs. Therefore, the PS will seek to: Streamline the role of the State in managing public participation in the sector and as an agent facilitating the internationalization of the defense industry; Promote dynamic capacity management, with the sale of equipment that is about to reach its use cycle or surplus, with a view to obtaining resources to be used in LPM and in support programs for the defense industry; Promote the participation of the National Defense industry to participate in joint programs, focusing on niches of excellence within the scope of the European Defense Agency, NATO and other cooperative programs. Value the exercise of functions in the area of ​​Defense The PS will adopt the necessary measures to recognize the specificity of the exercise of functions in the area of ​​National Defense, namely: Implementing the medium-term contract regime for functional situations whose level of education and training,
Chunk 2:
is urgent to make up for lost time and guarantee workers a progressive appreciation of their work, reconciling the objective of strengthening social cohesion with the sustainability of wage policy. The PS argues, therefore, that the target to be achieved for increasing the minimum wage must correspond to the update of the predicted value and that it is essential to build a new medium-term agreement with social partners that defines the criteria and a trajectory for the increase of the minimum wage in the following years; Unlock collective bargaining. 2. SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF COMPANY FINANCING Business investment must play a preponderant role, being a key variable for a strong and sustained recovery in economic growth. In a context of scarcity of financing, it is necessary to find new and effective ways of financing companies and boosting economic activity and job creation. Taking on this aim, the PS will mobilize resources and adapt the public support framework to the need for a rapid recovery in investment. To this end, it will act in six areas. Thus, firstly, the implementation of community funds will be streamlined and accelerated, ensuring their targeting to companies and exploring new sources of European financing to reinforce financing for the economy. Secondly, a capitalization fund will be created to support business investment. Thirdly, greater coordination and integration of investment support will be promoted, which includes encouraging new forms of private financing that expand financing options for companies and the creation of tax incentives for investment in business projects. Fourthly, initiatives will be adopted to encourage foreign investment in Portugal. Fifth, obstacles will be removed and investment time and cost will be reduced through a new Simplex program for companies . Finally, sixthly, selective investments will be studied and identified that allow maximum use of infrastructure investments already made and that can be monetized in favor of economic development. Accelerate the execution of community funds Taking advantage of opportunities in the next legislature involves making maximum use of the opportunities that are available to us. One of the most relevant lies in community funds which, in the coming years, could help boost the economy, the activities of Portuguese companies and employment. It is this fundamental instrument of public investment that needs to be accelerated and concentrated in priority areas, as it constitutes a powerful factor in helping economic development. To reinforce and accelerate the execution of community funds, the PS will: Give maximum priority to the extraordinary execution of European funds, involving organizational, legislative and coordination efforts with regions and partners that allow it to be carried out with quality and speed; Adopt the specific measures necessary for the immediate operationalization of the financial instruments (capital, guarantees and loans) provided for in Portugal 2020, essential for financing business investment; Promote the adaptation of the regulatory framework for the application of community funds quickly, ensuring quick solutions and resolving constraints; Boost investment and the ability to attract more financing through a proactive attitude in Europe in negotiations for

over-indebtedness situation of families supporting structured renegotiation with creditors and granting small low-interest loans to address specific and temporary difficulties for households at risk of losing their home; Local counseling service regarding homelessness: offering local integrated counseling services (financial, legal and social) to support families in a dramatic situation of imminent loss of their home; Exceptional regime for the protection of the debtor in the event of the foreclosure of a property secured by a mortgage, stipulating that, in situations of substantial reduction in the household's income and regardless of the creditor's consent, the delivery of the property (payment in payment) extinguishes the debt until to the limit of the bank assessment carried out (assuming the unity of all credits granted to complete the purchase and sale); Modification of the rules applicable to determining the base value for the sale of properties in the foreclosure process. Relaunch social housing policy In recent decades, and essentially on the impulse of the PS, much has been done in terms of providing social accommodation and eradicating precarious housing. However, in more recent years, the pursuit of a social housing policy has stagnated, which occurred precisely at a time when social conditions, the risk of poverty and unemployment worsened, accompanied by a significant reduction in social support. The new housing crisis we are experiencing justifies the need to relaunch social housing policy, adapting it to new needs and improving its responses. In this context, the PS will: Complete the implementation of the PIMP (Medium-Term Intervention Plan) and PER (Special Rehousing Program) programs, resume PER Famílias and create a similar program for consolidated and degraded buildings; Strengthen investment, through community funds, in the rehabilitation and improvement of the energy efficiency of the existing social housing stock, as well as in the rehabilitation of vacant buildings for social housing purposes; Create a network of supported housing (preferably in existing buildings to be rehabilitated), under a “family pension” regime, for people with low levels of resources, in situations of isolation or exclusion (in particular the elderly) and whose social and psychological situation or psychiatric treatment makes access to common housing unlikely; Promote participatory management of social neighborhoods, by strengthening the participation and involvement of social tenants. B. VALUE OUR TERRITORY The territory is the only strategic asset that we have full availability of, not depending on third parties for its valorization. It is therefore important to take advantage of all its potential, promoting balanced, harmonious and ecologically sustainable economic development, through rational use of our endogenous resources. To achieve this, traditional activities and crafts will have to be combined with the new possibilities opened up by technical advances, scientific discoveries and the influx of innovation and knowledge, but always with respect for the diversity and natural richness of our territory. This territorial development strategy will be carried out on two fronts. Not the thriving coastline and the interior that comes by drag. But two facades – the Atlantic and the peninsular – are equally worthy, which both

that all parenting support measures are aimed at fathers and mothers with children residing in Portugal, regardless of their nationality; Extend new legal mechanisms for reducing, adapting schedules or justifying absences to care for grandchildren to grandfathers and grandmothers. Eliminate obstacles to the return of emigrants and their movement In order to guarantee the movement and return of emigrants, practical conditions must be created to facilitate the return and movement of emigrants who left the country following the crisis, including: Promote the recognition of academic and professional qualifications, both in destination countries and in Portugal; Develop an incentive plan for emigrants who wish to return to Portugal; Facilitate the recognition of documents, such as driving licenses, both in destination countries and in Portugal; Guarantee the portability of social rights, in particular pensions, through agreements with host states; Enable, through agreements with host states, especially when it comes to non-EU countries, circular migration routes without loss of residence rights in the host country; Create, in consulates and embassies, return support offices that publicize work and entrepreneurship opportunities with emigrants and provide assistance on their return. Boost relations between emigrants and national society With the aim of creating an effective relationship with emigrant communities, which will allow all Portuguese people to be included in the country's economic and social development strategy, in addition to promoting the Portuguese language and culture among our emigrant communities, several measures may be important: Support the creation of emigrant networks, in particular among qualified emigrants and entrepreneurs; Support the connection between these emigrant networks and universities, R&D centers, companies and central and local public bodies; Stimulate the institutional appreciation of emigrants and their sense of belonging to the national community and foster relations with the Portuguese diaspora as a mechanism for facilitating the internationalization of the national economy and promoting Portugal's image in the world; Create an annual award for emigrants who stood out for their contribution to their community and the country; Support the participation of Portuguese emigrants in activities carried out in Portugal (conferences, projects, consultancies and other public and private initiatives); Encourage, with universities, the promotion of Portugal as a destination for Portuguese students emigrating on Erasmus and Study Abroad programs. Promote legal immigration channels, the development of an intercultural society and deepen the integration of immigrants In order to promote the attraction of immigrants, legal immigration channels and the integration of immigrant communities, the PS goes, beyond the status of Portuguese-speaking citizenship: Create a visa to look for a job in Portugal, valid for six months; Promote national universities internationally to carry out the Erasmus and Portugal program to set up new global companies; Create faster and more transparent mechanisms and procedures for granting visas in Portuguese consulates around the world; Promote intercultural education from the age of three, include the theme of interculturality in teacher training and value schools with good practices (continuation of the attribution of the intercultural seal); Reactivate the High Commission for Migration’s training pool; Streamline procedures regarding nationality,
Chunk 5:
including the restructuring of the central administration and its missions, reducing its weight in the system, focusing its activities on planning, evaluating and regulating the system, intervening, less and less, in the day-to-day activities of schools and groups. 3. INVEST IN ADULT EDUCATION AND LIFE-LONG TRAINING The action determined by the qualification of the Portuguese should not only focus on reducing school failure and abandonment and creating longer and higher quality educational paths for young people. Portugal continues to have a problem with the qualifications of our adults of working age, which currently has a triple dimension: The structural deficit in educational qualifications remains (62% of adults aged 25-64 did not complete secondary education); The increased and very serious problem of high unemployment rates, with relevance to the proportion of structural unemployment among the active population and the inadequacy of their professional skills in light of the changes occurring on a global scale in the productive fabric; It is The lack of intervention, on a scale and in depth, like that needed in the country to face the real situation. Despite this diagnosis being consensual, the PSD/CDS government canceled the New Opportunities initiative and did not replace it with any program to focus on adult qualifications, with all efforts to overcome one of the most serious deficits that harm the country currently being suspended. and the Portuguese. The continuity of public interventions in this area is a crucial element for reducing the qualifications deficit, as well as continuously improving the quality of adult education and training processes. It is, therefore, with this purpose that the PS will assume a fundamental objective to reestablish adult education and overcome one of the most serious national deficits. Create an Adult Education and Training Program that consolidates a lifelong learning system and its strategic action for the next decade Revitalize adult education and training as a central pillar of the qualifications system , ensuring the continuity of lifelong learning policies and the permanent improvement of the quality of learning processes and results, which seeks to: Based on complementarity between recognition and certification of skills and mandatory certified training based on the individual needs of trainees; Create adult counseling and guidance mechanisms that allow the referral of trainees based on their profile, training needs and opportunities for professional insertion and personal fulfillment, ensuring consistency with individuals' expectations; Create differentiated education-training paths based on the needs of specific groups, such as: Qualification-Employment Program for long-term unemployed people, workers in precarious employment situations and other vulnerable groups; Basic Skills Program for literacy, English language, ICT; post-secondary vocational programs for young adults with incomplete or completed secondary education; programs for scientific, cultural and civic promotion (participatory citizenship); training program for low-skilled entrepreneurs, among others; Revitalize adult education and training as a central pillar of the qualifications system, through the activation of a national network of centers specializing in adult education and training in service, advice, guidance and learning pathways, based on the real qualification needs of different territories/economic

agreement with the EU, NO to foreign judges, NO to Brussels diktats. Cancellation of the free movement of persons as well as the 1974 Convention on cross-border workers' refunds. No cohesion contribution to the EU. NO to the UN Pact on Migration. 2. Work: ours first Replace the useless "light indigenous preference" desired by the party system with the indigenous preference voted by the people. Investing to promote the hiring of unemployed Swiss workers. Less bureaucracy and fewer taxes for companies that create jobs for the Swiss. Defense of what remains of our financial center. NO to the abolition of banking secrecy for Swiss citizens. Public contracts only to Swiss companies registered in the sector for at least 5 years and with at least 50% Swiss or domiciled staff. 3. Autonomous migration policy We decide on immigration. Limitation of family reunions. Rapid and safe expulsion of all foreigners who commit crimes or abuse our social community: enough with the exceptions! Reduce social benefits for foreigners: we are not the country of Bengodi! Systematic repatriation of economic migrants, reception only for the truly persecuted. No new asylum centers in Ticino. All Islamic terrorists must be removed from Switzerland; and if they find themselves in danger in their country of origin, too bad for them! 4. Defense of our values We defend our identity, our traditions, our roots and our freedoms. Stop the dismantling of our militia army. NO to the Islamization of Switzerland: migrants arriving from "other cultures" adapt to our rules or return to their homeland. Ban on foreign financing of mosques and Islamic cultural centers. Valorization of popular rights! What the people vote for must be applied to the letter and quickly. Our Constitution comes before international agreements. International treaties that are contrary to the will of the people must be terminated. 5. Stop easy naturalizations Stop the easy naturalizations of people who are not integrated and/or dependent on the welfare state; limited number for naturalizations. The Swiss passport is not a right, but a reward for those who demonstrate that they deserve it. Withdrawal of Swiss citizenship from naturalized citizens who are guilty of particularly serious crimes. 6. No to raising the age AVS and priority for the Swiss in social relations Let's help the Swiss first. Stop immigration in our welfare state. Massive cuts to foreign aid and asylum spending, and more money for the First Pillar. No to raising the AVS age! 7. Sustainable health insurance Use the profits of the Confederation and the National Bank for the First Pillar and to reduce health insurance premiums. Creation of a single, public health insurance fund. Yes to capping the health insurance premium at 10% of household income. 8. Environment: no to hysteria, yes to reason No to climate hysteria, yes to a reasonable environmental policy, which is at the forefront of reducing immigration and border crossings. Increase in the tax on heavy traffic charged to foreign trucks that transit parasitically through Switzerland, in order to discourage the

manifesto the DUP stated: “We support the current UK Government pledge to renegotiate elements of our relationship with the European Union.” The deafness of the EU institutions to change in those negotiations meant that this process did not deliver the fundamental reform the EU required. Therefore, with no reasonable alternative available, the DUP chose to maintain its stance and advocate for a leave vote. Some would seek to make this a re-run of last year’s referendum. Our job now is not to refight old battles but to use our mandate and our influence to get the best deal for Northern Ireland. The United Kingdom’s departure from the European Union inevitably brings with it opportunities as well as challenges. Whichever way people voted in the referendum last June, and whatever concerns they may still have we can all unite to ensure Northern Ireland’s interests are promoted. For our part we will work to get the best deal for Northern Ireland, recognizing that we share a land frontier with the Republic and the particular circumstances of our unique history and geography. The circumstances of Northern Ireland are well understood and working together sensibly we have the opportunity to secure a good outcome that delivers for everyone. In the new Parliament, Northern Ireland needs to have a strong, united DUP team arguing the case for our people. DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS THE DUP WANTS TO SEE A FOCUS ON THE FOLLOWING PRIORITIES AND OBJECTIVES: Successful outward-looking knowledge-based economy in Northern Ireland Ease of trade with the Irish Republic and throughout the European Union Maintenance of the Common Travel Area Strengthened relationships across the four components parts of the United Kingdom with no internal borders Northern Ireland-specific solutions achieved through active Executive engagement Particular circumstances of Northern Ireland with a land border with the EU fully reflected Frictionless border with Irish Republic assisting those working or travelling in the other jurisdiction Progress on new free trade deals with the rest of the world Comprehensive free trade and customs agreement with the European Union Northern Ireland established as a hub for trade from Irish Republic into the broader UK market Customs arrangements which facilitate trade with new and existing markets Confidence and capacity within local businesses to maximize opportunities Business to retain competiveness and not face additional costs Arrangements to facilitate ease of movement of people, goods and services Proportionate regulatory regime which can promote competiveness, with legislation to suit our local needs Local input into new UK agriculture and fisheries policies which can offer sustainability and new growth opportunities Particular importance of agri-food sector to Northern Ireland economy recognised and reflected Strong protections for agri-food to guard against vulnerabilities to cheap inferior imports An appropriate support programme for our farmers should continue after we leave Effective immigration policy which meets the skills, labour and security needs of the UK Rights of British citizens in the EU and those from EU member states living here safeguarded Energy market stability Effective, time bound transitional arrangements where necessary

on fundamental unionist principles in order to retain power. We will not permit the rewriting of the past or the persecution of the security forces. We will oppose any Border Poll outside the terms of the Belfast Agreement. We will stand over those proposals for reform as set out in our ‘Making Stormont Work Better’ document which have not yet been delivered. We will work to ensure the full implementation of the Military Covenant in Northern Ireland. We will honour all previous commitments we have made on the basis that republicans will honour theirs as well. 2 Increasing Family Incomes Our national and local economy has been improving steadily over the last number of years. Indeed, Northern Ireland is performing better in some aspects than the rest of the UK. The DUP believes that it is essential that the benefits of economic growth are felt by everyone, everywhere. An improving economy must not just be for the benefit of big companies or confined to London and the South East. Growth must also have a meaningful and positive impact on the lives of hardworking families in every part of our nation. We welcome the fact that median gross weekly earnings for full-time employees increased by 2.2% in Northern Ireland last year. That made it the second consecutive annual increase in inflation adjusted earnings in the region. We want to see continued improvement in earnings and incomes. We understand that it will be the responsibility of the Party that forms the next Government to bring forward a Budget that encourages economic growth and protects our society’s most vulnerable. The DUP proposes measures aimed at increasing family incomes that we seek to have included in future Budgets. INCREASE THE NATIONAL LIVING WAGE The newly introduced National Living Wage (NLW) has helped increase family incomes across the United Kingdom. Whilst acknowledging the pressures that the NLW can place upon small businesses, the DUP believes that it can have a positive impact on working families, help lift people out of poverty and make work pay. The DUP supports:Continued increases in the National Living Wage; and Firm action against companies who fail to pay their staff the NLW. FURTHER INCREASE THE PERSONAL TAX ALLOWANCE The DUP were frontrunners in proposing increases in the personal tax allowance. We firmly believe that the gradual increase in the personal tax allowance has been positive for all taxpayers but especially for the lowest paid, taking them out of the tax system entirely, and hugely beneficial for thousands of people from Northern Ireland. In Parliament, we will support proposals to further increase the personal allowance. FREEZE THEN CUT OR ABOLISH THE TV LICENCE AND REFORM THE BBC The TV licence fee is a highly regressive tax which was designed for a different era and a world of communication that no longer exists. The success of Netflix and Amazon streaming services shows that subscription based media can and does work. An independent Commission should be established to conduct a review of how

Budget to be set so they can get the support they need. To progress much needed health reforms – our National Health Service faces unprecedented pressures. The DUP kick started much needed reforms aimed at creating a new model of health and social care and reducing bureaucracy and streamlining structures. Those reforms are now effectively on hold with challenges like waiting lists mounting. People should not have to wait any longer to have those reforms implemented and problems tackled. To protect and improve our education system – the impact of not having an Executive in place is already being felt across our school system. Having an Executive up and running is critical to resolving the funding crisis facing our schools thus ensuring that we prioritise frontline funding for our schools so that all our children receive the best educational start in life. It is vital that we build on positive practical reforms in education. To attract investment and jobs – it is no coincidence that our record levels of inward investment have happened during a sustained period of devolution. Having stable structures at Stormont with local Ministers leading efforts to sell Northern Ireland internationally has helped us secure thousands of new jobs. Without devolution, all of the efforts to reduce our rate of Corporation tax will have been for nothing. Political stability is key to our future economic success. THE STRONGEST, MOST EXPERIENCED UNIONIST TEAM READY FOR NEGOTIATIONS Immediately after the General Election, we will enter another round of negotiations. The DUP will place the interests of the people of Northern Ireland first in those negotiations. We will not draw any red lines or put any roadblocks in the way of seeing an Executive formed straight away. It is absolutely imperative that voters use this election to not only send a clear message that they want to see Stormont restored but also give unionism the strongest possible hand in the talks. No other Party has the strength, unity or experience of delivering for unionism that the DUP possesses. Unionists remember what it was like in the past when Sinn Fein were able to advance their radical republican agenda in negotiations, aided and abetted by weak unionists. This all changed when the DUP started to lead unionism. Since 2003, the DUP has slowly but surely regained ground for unionism culminating in the Stormont House and Fresh Start Agreements. Sinn Fein have sought to use their mandate at the last Assembly election to block the re-establishment of the Assembly, to demand a destabilising Border Poll and to push their agenda. It’s time for unionists to come out and vote so the real voice of Northern Ireland is heard. The DUP needs a strong mandate to stand strong against Sinn Fein’s demands. Immediately after the election on 8 June the negotiations aimed at restoring devolution will recommence with a view to establishing a new Executive by 29 June. We will enter these negotiations with a positive approach and a goal of seeing the
Chunk 4:
not solely about realising efficiencies so that Northern Ireland can live within its means. It is also about delivering a more effective public sector and freeing up resources to be spent on priorities like schools, hospitals and policing. The DUP wants to continue to reform our public sector. This is our Plan to improve public services in Northern Ireland. A NATIONAL REFORM PLAN FOR NORTHERN IRELAND The DUP believes that all parties should agree to the creation of a structured, long term, cross-government National Reform Plan for Northern Ireland including measurable targets and agreed implementation dates. Elements of a National Reform Plan for Northern Ireland could include: alternative models of service delivery such as increasing the use of social enterprises; a Civil Service Reform Plan; a more digital government; expanding shared services provision; and a dedicated Change Fund to stimulate reform. A GOOD BUDGET SETTLEMENT The DUP will fight hard at Westminster for a Budget settlement that allows for real terms increases in health and education spending over the next parliamentary term and will prioritise these areas in future Northern Ireland Budgets. PROGRESSING HEALTH REFORMS The DUP were in the driving seat in developing ambitious, far sighted reforms for our National Health Service in Northern Ireland. These reforms including the Bengoa Panel’s recommendations for a new model of health and social care, and proposals to eliminate a layer of bureaucracy by abolishing the HSC Board are much needed. The DUP supports these reforms and wants to see them progressed as a matter of urgency. Similarly, our Health Service needs a properly resourced plan to reduce waiting lists and a dedicated Transformation Fund to support reform. Health is fundamental to every person in Northern Ireland. The DUP will continue to strive for a situation where key decisions about the enhancement of the NHS in Northern Ireland are free from party politics. GIVING EVERY CHILD THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED The DUP is committed to defending and improving our education system in Northern Ireland to ensure that every child has the opportunity to succeed in life. We will fight for sufficient resources to be provided for frontline schools budgets, and for greater autonomy in decision making for schools. We support academic selection, the maintenance of the Dickson Plan, and greater value being placed on vocational qualifications. We will focus on tackling educational underachievement through support for early years interventions, n expanded childcare strategy and community based initiatives. The DUP supports equality of treatment for all education sectors, including removal of discrimination in teacher employment, as well as increased shared education across all education sectors. SAFER STREETS AND SMARTER JUSTICE Maintaining law and order is one of government’s primary duties. The DUP supports the justice family across the United Kingdom in the fight against crime in all its increasingly complex guises. The DUP supports: The adoption a ‘Problem Solving’ approach in our courts; A measure of protection for the Police in future Budgets; An increased focus on cyber crime; the introduction of a NI

as the UK’s aviation hub with increased air connectivity to Northern Ireland; Seek an independent investigation into ferry price structures on North Channel and Irish Sea routes between Northern Ireland and Great Britain; Develop a comprehensive Broadband Infrastructure Plan to roll out high speed internet connectivity across Northern Ireland; Continue to press the mobile telephony providers to invest in their networks ensuring 4G provision across Northern Ireland and that we are at the forefront of future 5G investments; and Establish the new Northern Ireland Infrastructure Fund as quickly as possible. 4 Improving Public Services The DUP has a track record of positively reforming public services and streamlining the political system. Due to our determination, we have delivered: a reduction in the number of Government Departments from 12 to 9; a reduction in the number of Special Advisors; a reduction in the number of MLAs per constituency from 6 to 5; and a reduction in the number of Councils from 26 to 11. The DUP has also been the driving force behind a series of public sector reforms which are aimed at developing a more effective and more efficient government. These include: a Civil Service Voluntary Exit Scheme yielding annual savings of approximately £100 million; a Public Sector Reform Architecture including the NI Public Sector Innovation Laboratory; and a suite of internationally renowned Shared Services which have saved the public purse hundreds of millions of pounds in reduced office, IT, procurement and energy costs. Reforming public services is Register of Animal Cruelty Offenders and the seriousness of these animal cruelty offences reflected in the sentences handed down by courts; the PSNI in their efforts to target criminal gangs and ensure they have all the powers necessary to seize assets of paramilitary godfathers 5 Defending Our Nation from Old and New Threats The DUP does not believe that the present defence arrangements for the United Kingdom are adequate enough to cope with the emerging threats in the 21st Century. We appreciate that in a time of significant challenge to public finances, almost all areas will be affected, but more consideration needs to be given to prioritising the funding of defence. In order to afford it some protection, the DUP supported the UK maintaining the NATO target of 2% of GDP for the Defence Budget, despite reservations about the funding formula. However, it would be unwise to allow the present funding, strength and plans for our Armed Forces to become the accepted norm. History demonstrates that re-growing defence capability in times of national crisis is both disproportionately expensive and too late. It should be remembered that the NATO target is intended as a minimum figure not a ceiling for Defence expenditure. There is also legitimacy to the charge that the UK has only maintained the 2% target through a new definition of Defence spending. In the next term, it is expected that the UK public finances should improve. When we achieve this we believe Defence should be one of the priorities for new

We are and will be committed to the development of an environmentally friendly sustainable industry by all means and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. 75. Smart solutions and a smart economy make it possible to reduce environmental pollution by minimizing the negative impact of human activities on nature. With the help of these smart tools, we can create healthier and more environmentally friendly cities, communities and organize human activities in such a way that we do as little damage to nature as possible. Therefore, we must implement, support and promote the use of smart technologies that protect the environment in state management and people's daily lives. 76. The energy perspective outlined by the Social Democrats - increasing the efficiency of energy consumption, development of own power generation capacity (primarily, energy from renewable resources), modernization and development of hydroaccumulation, development of distributed (decentralized) electricity generation and storage, smart electricity grids, development of biofuel and biomass cogeneration, installation of energy from renewable resources in buildings. 77. A solidary society includes not only solidarity between people, but also the protection of the rights of the animals that live next to us. We will ensure the protection of the rights of domestic animals and the inevitable responsibility of those who torture them, and we will actively and consistently fight against poaching. Close ties with Lithuanians of the world and solidarity with people of all nationalities 78. Lithuania's demographic situation – the consistently worsening ratio of working people to people of non-working age – requires urgent state decisions regarding the return of emigrants to Lithuania. The Social Democrats undertake to create and implement a systematic state program based on economic, social, educational and other promotion measures, which would allow to ensure the return of a significant part of emigrants of working age to Lithuania. All necessary state resources must be used for this, because if we do not stabilize the demographic situation, we will not avoid enormous economic and social problems. 79. The Social Democrats hold the unequivocal position that every Lithuanian, regardless of whether he has acquired the citizenship of another state, must have the right to preserve Lithuanian citizenship. We will consistently strive to enshrine this principle in the Constitution and laws of the Republic of Lithuania. 80. Lithuanian communities abroad, youth unions and other foreign Lithuanian organizations are cradles of Lithuanianness all over the world. The Lithuanian Social Democratic Party undertakes to support them in every possible way, ensuring that their activities, which help to maintain the connection of the Lithuanian diaspora with the Motherland, will not be interrupted and will be strengthened. 81. The Social Democrats are convinced that maintaining and developing Lithuanian schools in foreign countries is one of the key tasks in order to preserve the national identity of the Lithuanian diaspora. 82. The Social Democrats undertake to ensure mutual communication between Lithuanians living abroad and Lithuania in order to maintain the interest of these people in Lithuania and its life and to encourage them to contribute with their good

democracy - a safe, solidary and happy society, with the aim of improving living conditions for everyone and everything. 15. Clearly formulated and understandable rights, duties and responsibilities for everyone (people, government, business, media, trade unions, non-governmental organizations) will create a new social cohesion of our society and will enable everyone to participate, contribute to the creation of wealth and benefit from the growth of public goods. 16. Society needs progressive political forces, determined to achieve a welfare state and a safe, solidary and happy society and not deviating from this path. Only with long-term goals can effective measures be developed to implement new political aspirations. We - social democrats - present such a decisive plan in this program. II. OUR ESSENTIAL GOALS FOR THE SUCCESS OF LITHUANIA Working Lithuania 17. The values ​​and actions of social democrats arise from the ethical attitude that the goal can only be a person. Material wealth and production are only a means to create human well-being. Our goal is full employment, when a person who has been dismissed from work is given the conditions and assistance to get back into work within a reasonable period of time. Lithuania must make use of the talents and skills of each person and develop and improve them. This is Lithuania's path towards prosperity for all and a happier society. High quality employment must be ensured. The Social Democrats undertake to create and implement a program of work for the entire society, which, when implemented, would ensure the supply and demand of high-quality and efficient jobs in the state, movement of persons between professions and the training of specialists needed by the state. A stable welfare state is not possible without full employment. The dynamism of the labor market must be increased through the use of social dialogue, job security and promotion support measures in all periods of a person's working career. 18. The Social Democrats will pay particular attention to the youth. Quality and affordable education, support programs for starting an independent life, affordable first home, guaranteed jobs, compatibility of family and work, this is our guarantee for young people. 19. There must be enough space in the labor market for both the young and the old, whose experience is very much needed by the youth. Therefore, seniors must be given the conditions to work and realize themselves without any age discrimination. 20. Creative and quality work is the main value and source of well-being. Lithuania must become a country of productive and quality work, whose residents should not have to look for work abroad. As a result, it is necessary to support the creation of high-quality, high-productivity jobs in every possible way, upgrading and retraining, lifelong learning in order to achieve the highest possible employment of the population. A person has the right to actively participate in social life and the work process. Its responsibility is to take advantage of the opportunities provided by training and professional development programs and the development of human and
Chunk 3:
all; effective and timely social assistance; the development of a creative and intelligent society; effective use of modern technologies in solving public, social and economic challenges; general population employment; ensuring national security by all necessary means; preservation and nurturing of national and cultural identity. 4. We offer Lithuania a political, economic, social and cultural democracy based on social democratic values, because only with the totality of these forms of democracy is it possible to create a state of social welfare for all, a safe, solidary and happy society. 5. Social democrats adhere to the position that basic human rights and freedoms are natural. No person may be humiliated or discriminated against or given privileges because of his sex, race, nationality, language, origin, social status, faith, beliefs or views. 6. Man lives in unity with the environment and society, affects them and is affected by them. His personal dignity and freedom of choice are better manifested when he is socially protected and provided for. Every democratic system must constantly look for solutions that help create conditions for people to be materially self-sufficient, prevent the humiliation of human dignity, and promote the realization of their potential. 7. Social democrats adhere to the position that human moral freedom is the most important value. A materially and spiritually independent person can develop his abilities, express his free choice. Individual freedom is incompatible with the promotion of dictatorship, totalitarianism, religious fundamentalism, radical nationalism or xenophobia. 8. The main task of the social democrats' economic, social and cultural policy is to create conditions for people's abilities to unfold and to use them to create common social welfare and to satisfy individual needs. Social justice requires removing any kind of discrimination against a person, helping a person with physical, mental or social difficulties. Equality of opportunity recognizes the value of all people and is a fundamental condition for personal expression. 9. The principle of competition expressing market relations must be complemented by the principle of solidarity. Solidarity is a way to insure against negative factors and an opportunity to ensure effective protection of personal rights through social dialogue. Solidarity implementation measures include tax and financial system levers, market regulation mechanisms for social welfare needs, social policy instruments and others. Social Democrats advocate a socially oriented market economy, but not a market society. This is what makes us different from right-wing parties. We strive for a balance between individuality and community, competition and solidarity, freedom and responsibility. 10. Freedom, social justice, security, solidarity and tolerance are fully revealed when they complement and enrich each other. Freedom without equal opportunities degenerates into privilege. The indiscriminate implementation of the principle of equality without the development of the individual and ensuring freedom ends in coercion and dictatorship. Where the principles of freedom and justice are implemented without the solidarity of people, a society corresponding to their dignity is not created. 11. The diversity of forms of ownership enables the best satisfaction of the complex needs of the state and society. Private,

strengthening the external dimension of the common EU energy policy and a unified coordinated dialogue with third countries. 107. In the light of new security challenges, NATO remains the only collective defense system that ensures crisis prevention, deterrence of possible aggressions, peacekeeping missions and collective defense in cases of possible attacks. We have no doubt that NATO must change in response to expansion and new threats. In the NATO format, it is mandatory to seek consensus with the allies. NATO provides its members with strong security guarantees. Lithuania must ensure the defense readiness of adequate power and to achieve as soon as possible the implementation of the defense financing commitments entered into with this organization. The fundamental interest of Lithuania is to strengthen relations between the European Union and the United States by all means and to expand the strategic cooperation between Lithuania and the USA, especially in the fields of military security, energy and economy, to seek the direct presence of US military forces in the Baltic and Central European states. 108. The economic dimension of foreign policy plays an increasingly important role in Lithuanian foreign policy. The development of economic diplomacy forms a business-friendly environment abroad. We will be active in helping businesses to expand their export markets, analyzing and offering new opportunities, studying market reliability and predictability. We will organize business missions in promising markets, we will look for new, efficient forms of work. Open and accountable government 109. The principle of a democratic society - it is not the government that gives people rights and freedoms, but voters give the government the authority to protect human rights and freedoms. Only following this principle, democratic relations are directly connected with responsibility to society. 110. Progress is the engine of state development, and the participation of Lithuanian people in democratic processes is an invaluable value that needs to be strengthened and nurtured. Modern information technologies make it possible to create platforms, thanks to which citizens can more easily get involved in state management at various stages of these processes - from submitting proposals to participating in elections. Ensuring and developing democracy requires broad citizen involvement in policy making and implementation. Therefore, we will encourage the development and implementation of technological solutions that will ensure and promote the implementation of the civil and political rights of the citizens of Lithuania, we will seek to introduce online voting in elections and referenda at all levels. 111. After implementing direct mayoral elections, we will continue to strive to democratize the procedures for appointing government representatives and to reform decision-making so that it meets the principles of democracy, transparency and legality, as well as the expectations of the people of Lithuania. 112. By using the opportunities provided by smart technologies, significant progress can be achieved in order to make state management efficient and transparent, therefore, we advocate the wide use of these information technologies in the organization and implementation of state management at all stages of these processes. 113. Government transparency can

areas and expansion of economic and social activities, self-government of agricultural organizations and communities of rural residents. All legal and economic means and methods must be used to encourage and support family commodity farms, which would be the basis of farming and rural lifestyle in the future. 49. We will strengthen the youth employment policy in the regions, paying particular attention to the inclusion of young people with fewer opportunities in the regional labor market. We will encourage the migration of young specialists to Lithuanian municipalities further away from the big cities, thus creating a coherent regional development policy in Lithuania and reducing the social and economic divide between different regions of Lithuania. 50. Social-democratic regional policy is based on the provisions that it is necessary to expand and mobilize state support for problem regions not only by providing preferential loans or loan guarantees for business projects, tax exemptions, but also in financial or other forms of subsidies, financing selected infrastructural and social projects; when applying structural development regulatory levers, use clear, quantitatively defined criteria for distinguishing the most problematic regions. According to those criteria, it is necessary to seek international and provide Government support for regions recognized as problematic. 51. We, social democrats, undertake to create and implement an agricultural and rural development strategy that would achieve more efficient use of local genetic resources, the development of the fruit, berry and vegetable sectors is encouraged, natural poultry breeding, rabbit breeding, sheep and goat breeding, beef cattle breeding are developed, the preservation of endangered plant and animal species is ensured, organic farms are being developed. We will create favorable conditions for cooperation in the processing of primary agricultural production and we will develop a specialized cooperative in agriculture. Socially protected society 52. The priority of social democrats is a solidary and socially protected society where it is good and safe to live, work, create families, give birth and raise children. A full-fledged life of the people of Lithuania must be ensured by productive work, and for those unable to work, social protection is based on the principle of social solidarity. 53. One of the main tasks of social democrats is the solution of demographic problems, because the increase in the population is the main condition for the survival of the nation. For this reason, we will encourage birth rates by supporting families. We want the country's population not to decrease, but to increase, so that families are willing and able to maintain and properly educate as many children as possible. We are for the kind of family that people raising children today want. We are convinced that the birth of children should not reduce the family's income, limit both parents' professional aspirations, education, career achievements, their cultural interests and quality of life. As a result, we will continue to expand universal support for every child (benefits, free meals, increasing the tax-free minimum income, etc.). We will increase childcare benefits. We will make it possible for both parents to work, ensuring

offer, the professionalism and competence of the staff, the planned approach to the duration of the tourist season, the underutilization of numerous tourist gems on the entire territory of our country. In short, the race for short-term profit is often faster than the quality of long-term tourism development, which causes significant consequences for future processes. What does Democratic Montenegro offer? Adoption of the Tourism Development Strategy of Montenegro for the period until 2030; development of rural, cultural, religious, ecotourism, sports tourism (example of Antalya, Turkey), which represents a trend in the world that is reflected in new tourist offers; improvement of the tourist offer based on the "sun and sea" holiday, which certainly dominates, the development of rural tourism, monastery tours, wine tours, fishing at sea, rivers, lakes and numerous other contents that will enrich the overall tourist offer of Montenegro; improving cruise tourism, by building pylons and making safety connections for ships in Kotor, as well as by opening the Port of Bar for cruise ships, where visits to Bar, Ulcinj, as well as Lake Skadar would have the opportunity to promote this part of our country through excursion tourism; formation of coordinating bodies at the level of coastal municipalities and key tourist municipalities in the north, which would be in charge of monitoring the tourist season, timely response and problem solving in communication with the competent Ministry; registration of foreigners' residence must be regular, simple and fast because now we have a selective and very bad record that causes dissatisfaction and resentment among tourists; The maritime domain must be more rigorous in its criteria when announcing a tender for the lease of bathing areas with precise obligations and provision of a control system; the ban on construction works from June 15 to September 15 must be substantial, not just formal; - reform of the system of tourist organizations; due to the need for adequate monitoring of the tourist season, significant investments are needed in: the Protection and Rescue Service, the Port Authority, the Maritime Safety Administration, the Naval Unit of the Police, utility companies; establishment of tourist clinics to provide medical assistance to tourists whose services will be free of charge, i.e. at the expense of the state; introduction of mandatory and continuous education for all employees in tourism; connecting tourism with domestic local food producers; public administration reform, to make it easier for tourism investors to enter the market; building hotel capacities, especially in those cities where this has been a necessary need for many years; a significantly higher degree of investment in transport infrastructure as a prerequisite for the development of tourism. WATER MANAGEMENT AND FORESTRY Our task: Stop the irresponsible attitude of the state towards our forests, watercourses, rivers and lakes! Introduction: The potential of rivers and lakes in Montenegro is exceptional and constitutes an invaluable resource for the further development of Montenegro. Management of these resources by the state through granting concessions to irresponsible concessionaires and the unauthorized exploitation of gravel and sand have
Chunk 2:
motive to redistribute resources instead of creating them: it takes resources from everyone, and primarily satisfies the interest of the group that supports its survival in power. The elite below the top of the political pyramid also engage in redistributing resources to their advantage. Montenegrin society is paying a high price for political entrepreneurship and the technology of an irresponsible government. The judiciary does not ensure an optimal level of legal security and does not enjoy the high trust of citizens. The causes of this were the weakening of the mechanisms of supervision and the strengthened mechanisms of pressure from other segments of the state apparatus. but also an unbearable level of indifference to lawlessness, as well as any individual deprived of the belief that he can exert a significant influence on social outcomes with his own strength. Weak protection of rights by the judiciary in our society leads to multiple harmful phenomena: increasingly frequent use of non-institutional resources (self-protection), engagement of illegal groups for debt collection and contract protection and what is worst is the habituation of citizens to the weaknesses of the judiciary and the inaccessibility of justice. The system of selection, dismissal and promotion of judicial personnel is not completely and coherently regulated, and constitutional and legal designs are out of step with social reality. Political instability in Montenegro and the probability of losing power hinders comprehensive reforms of state administration and causes the continuity of irrational spending of resources in the public sector. The irresponsible government has in mind that the consequences of the comprehensive reform of the state administration are long-term and has no motive to approach them because it is oriented towards short-term gains in the processes of constant political campaigns (in which it can lose not only political mandates but also deposits of illegally acquired capital). Of particular concern is the constant decline in the reputation of the state administration and persistent negative selection of staff in the public sector! The creation of voting machinery implies the engagement of a part of incompetent and irresponsible staff in the state administration. Incompetent is the one who has no business opportunities outside the state administration and treats the political authorities uncritically. Irresponsible is the one who does not suffer moral sanction, does not question himself, and he listens to the other without question. Hiring incompetent staff brings down the reputation of the state administration and affects existing and potential quality staff. It wrongly sends a bad signal about the first, and it sends a bad signal to the others and dissuades them from applying for a job in the state administration. The salary system and the method of evaluating the work of civil servants and employees is not objectified and is not deprived of opportunities for volunteerism, i.e. the arbitrariness of the elders of the body. The state administration faces great challenges in order to realize the tasks imposed by the market-oriented socio-economic organization and integration processes. State administration must operate within the principles of
Chunk 3:
our children. Insistence on artificially produced divisions must remain a policy of the past. Such a policy did not bring good to Montenegro or its citizens, and it will not do the same for generations to come. because the quasi-politics of division compromises not only the state as a unique organism, but also man as a human being. DEPOLITIZED MONTENEGRO What does Democratic Montenegro offer? Overcoming divisions on any basis; z reconciliation and agreement with those who wish good for Montenegro and its citizens; equal chances for everyone, regardless of which political option they advocated, how they declared themselves nationally, what language they spoke and what religion they belonged to; eliminating politics from all educational institutions and leaving education policy to the most capable and successful; abolition of the practice of knowing the results of the competition in advance and giving chances to the most capable; eliminating the policy of revanchism towards political dissenters; establishment of a new rule: party to politicians, health to doctors, economy to experts, judiciary to competent, education to professors, better life for all citizens; those who think differently will not be enemies, but controllers of the government; the repressive state apparatus will be accountable to citizens and civil control bodies, not to party henchmen; the language, history and culture of minorities and minority groups will be part of the history and culture of the whole of Montenegro. The future begins with victories, not divisions. MONTENEGRO IN EUROPE Our task Montenegro is the country of the European future! Introduction: The dilemma of whether the state should enter into some form of alliance with other states, in order to contribute to the very reasons for its creation, which consist in the guarantee of its prosperity, security and sustainability, is almost as old as the country itself. Even during early history, immediately after the creation of the first states, many of them, for various reasons, decided to unite with, most often, their neighbors. Later, the recipe "association for the betterment" was applied on all continents, which resulted in success much more often. Thus, even today there are centuries-old state alliances, which have not only withstood the test of time, but are considered the most developed state or supranational creations in the world. One of those, the truth - of recent date, to which Democratic Montenegro strongly aspires, is the European Union. What is particularly important for citizens, and especially for young people, is that membership in the European Union provides opportunities for a life without borders. This implies the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, unhindered movement of people, schooling, employment under equal conditions in the member states of the European Union. This is why it is important for Montenegro to join the community of European states, but it is even more important that European values ​​take root in Montenegro. The project of Montenegro's accession to the European Union must be reflected in the way of life, the standard of citizens, the construction and affirmation of social values
Chunk 4:
legalization of informal buildings or the construction of several hundred apartments for certain social groups is not enough, nor are experimental or pilot projects such as "1000 plus apartments". Mass construction of cheap housing units is necessary, regardless of whether the resulting fund will be used as social or public housing, rental or ownership. Today, when modern materials and construction technologies ensure the production of apartments for around 200 euros per m2 - it is not a question of finances, but a question of the will of the political majority and responsible politicians. SOCIAL POLICY, SOLIDARITY AND CARE OF THE ELDERLY Our task: Montenegro is a state of social justice, solidarity and social security. Introduction: Montenegro must become a state of social justice and a responsible social society, because it is a condition of its social cohesion, and thus its progress. Democratic Montenegro attaches great importance to the achievement of this goal. The solidarity of the entire society and the state with the vulnerable and the weak is the fundamental value of the social policy that Democratic Montenegro stands for. The strength of society is recognized by how much it is willing to do for those who once did for them. The people who built this country must not be allowed to live on the brink of misery today. Social protection of persons who are unable to work and do not have the means to live, secure and dignified old age, must be the concern of the state. The state cannot take upon itself the solution of all life issues and problems of citizens - individuals cannot be released from responsibility for their existence and the existence of their family. Description of the condition: Montenegro is a country where the participation of the elderly in the total structure of the population is significantly represented. We live in a time when the traditional family is losing its basic role of togetherness, which guaranteed family care for the elderly, especially for parents and other close relatives. Today, the family increasingly loses its protective role and care for the elderly, because newly created work and other obligations require absence from the family. Faced with material problems and their own difficulties, people express less and less solidarity with those who need it. These changes in the family were not followed by the state's efforts to develop organized institutions that, in the area of ​​caring for the elderly, would partially or fully take over the role of the family. A worryingly small number of old people's homes, day care homes for the elderly and other facilities that would ensure social solidarity and care for the elderly were built. The transition process and the opening of bankruptcy proceedings had serious consequences for employees in Montenegro and their families. Tens of thousands of workers, after the bankruptcy or liquidation of their companies, are referred to the Employment Office to survive with very low benefits on the basis of unemployment, without any prospect of new employment. AGE MUST
Chunk 5:
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE Our task: The modernization of Montenegro is not a job for only one person and only for one party. Introduction: According to the census from 2011, the participation of citizens between 15 and 30 years of age in the total number of inhabitants in Montenegro is 21.4% or a total of 132,701 inhabitants. What are the problems of young people? Do they have fears? How do they imagine life? Is Montenegro the country of the future? Every democratic government and every modern state must have an answer to these and many other questions Young people form their attitudes and values ​​under the influence of their family, their peers, the media, the educational system and society as a whole, striving to achieve the highest social values ​​that dominate in the modern democratic world. All this leads us to the conclusion that the period of physical and psychological maturation is a very complex and sensitive process in the life of each individual. Description of the condition: Young people in Montenegro are excluded from the decision-making process, and therefore they are denied the opportunity to create their own future and actively participate in shaping the country in which they want to live. The Montenegrin economy is in such a state that it does not open the possibility of creating job opportunities for young people. In Montenegro, young people are used as cheap and mostly simple labor force, in which the job is most often obtained with a party card, and not with knowledge and personal abilities. Youth unemployment is drastically higher than the unemployment of other categories of residents. Young people find it increasingly difficult to find work, and their expertise and level of education are not taken into account when selecting candidates, but party affiliation and suitability are almost the only criteria for selection, which lowers the quality of work in case of possible employment. Montenegro lacks numerous cultural, artistic and sports facilities, which negatively affects the development and maturation of young people. The atmosphere of party divisions and previously known results of the competition resulted in a loss of motivation for education, work and training, which drastically increased the percentage of "brain drain" from Montenegro to economically and economically developed countries. The extremely difficult material situation makes it impossible for a huge number of young people to travel, to get an education, to live independently and to found their families. MODERN MONTENEGRO What does Democratic Montenegro offer? In every modern country, young people are a symbol of freedom and democracy, and they must be given the chance to freely create the future and they fight for the realization of basic human rights and freedoms of man and citizen; we will adopt and consistently apply the National Strategy for Youth with the aim of fundamentally improving the status of young people in Montenegro and the creation of a modern state and modern conditions for the life and work of young people; we will work on creating a new generation

Introducing fees for access to a doctor would violate this provision. Opposition to transforming hospitals into companies. We oppose the commercialization and privatization of hospitals. Healthcare entities financed from public funds should not operate to make a profit. We demand that it be possible to create new public hospitals and clinics in the form of SPZOZ. The state will guard the secular nature of health care. Doctors should treat in accordance with the state of medical knowledge, and not guided by their own religious worldview.

Funds for drug reimbursement should be increased. The poorest seniors should receive medicines for free. Reimbursement of in vitro infertility treatment. The right to have children belongs to all people, regardless of their level of wealth. Legalization of medical marijuana and hemp oil. Consent to scientific research on their use. The treatment of patients should be guided by the latest medical knowledge, not prejudices. Free access to remote care for the elderly. The life button allows you to immediately call for help in a life- or health-threatening situation. Increasing the number of places in medical studies by 50%. The Polish health service suffers from a shortage of doctors. For example, there are 334 geriatricians in Poland. There are 314 counties in Poland. Theoretically, there is one geriatrician per district. In fact, in many counties there is not a single geriatrician. Therefore, admission limits for medical specializations should also be increased. EDUCATION Education is the best investment. We want it to be free and available from preschool. A good school is a modern, friendly school, free from religious indoctrination. The state should protect such a school. Increasing spending on education. Poland, with spending on education amounting to 4.94% of GDP, ranks 9th from the bottom in the EU ranking. For comparison, in 2005 Poland spent 5.47% of its GDP on education. Liquidation of junior high schools. Back to eight-grade primary school. Junior high schools are a failed educational experiment. The same educational goals could be achieved by reforming the core curriculum, without changing the organizational structure of Polish education. We emphasize that junior high schools contribute to the accumulation of educational problems. At the same time, we support maintaining the 12-year period of school education, which is a guarantee of maintaining teachers' jobs. Changing the education system should take place in consultation with local government officials. Public local government nurseries and kindergartens free of charge for at least eight hours a day. Pre-school education should be as accessible and free as education in primary school, junior high school or post-secondary school. Pre-school education should be financed by the state budget as part of the educational subsidy. Nursery care should also be available and free for all children. That

significantly reduced thanks to active state policy. The right to leave and sick leave for people employed under civil law contracts. Persons employed under civil law contracts should have the same social rights as persons employed full-time. Obligation to use social clauses in public procurement. One of the forms of fighting with junk contracts, preference should be given to companies employing employees under employment contracts in tenders organized by public institutions. Unfreezing the wages of public sector employees. Donald Tusk's government froze the wages of public sector employees under the pretext of the economic crisis. It was an attempt to shift the costs of overcoming the crisis onto the middle class and the poorest. We reject this policy. A wage increase in the public sector will increase consumption and will increase economic growth. Increasing the amount of annual leave for employees. In the case of 8 years of work experience, up to 24 days, and in the case of 10 years of work experience, up to 30 days. According to data from international organizations, Poles are one of the hardest-working societies in Europe. Equal pay for equal work. Active state policy to eliminate the differences in earnings between women and men performing the same work. We advocate supporting the employment of single women raising children. PENSIONS Increasing the retirement age is an example of a change introduced against the public and against the election announcements of the ruling party. This reform must be repaired in a way acceptable to Poles. Employees should have the right to decide - after achieving appropriate length of service - when they will retire. Lowering the retirement age. Employees should have the right to retire after 40 years of work - for men, and for women - after 35 years of work. Recognizing the period of employment under civil law contracts as seniority. In the current situation on the labor market, this is a necessity. Otherwise, the entire generation employed under junk contracts will not have the right to a pension. Higher pensions for widows and widowers. Currently, after the death of a husband or wife, the other spouse receives 85% of his pension. However, he must then waive his benefit. We want widows and widowers to be able to receive their pension and part of the benefit (25%) after their deceased spouse or survivor's pension after the deceased spouse and in this case 25% of your own pension. Raising the lowest pensions by PLN 200. Percentage indexation of other pensions. Pensioners should participate in sharing the fruits of economic growth. Protecting the pension system by increasing the number of Poles employed under an employment contract and paying pension contributions. The stability of the pension system depends on the number of employees making contributions. Therefore, instead of raising the retirement age, employment under an employment contract should be promoted. ECONOMIC POLICY Economic policy should implement four priorities: dynamic economic growth, full employment as possible, active role of the state, knowledge-based economy. These priorities should be

can conduct paid training only if they set hearing dates at intervals of no longer than two months. Solving the problem of court experts. The new act should ensure: shortening the waiting time for expert opinions, expanding the list of experts, creation of clear criteria for obtaining the status of an expert and a system of control over the work of experts. Completing the process of computerization of courts and prosecutor's offices. This will facilitate the coordination of setting hearing dates and reduce the waiting time for the resolution of trials. Making the rates for official legal aid more realistic. Today, lawyers handling cases ex officio receive remuneration from the state that is inadequate to the work they contribute. New act on the prosecutor's office. Increasing the independence of individual prosecutors, reducing the number of official prosecutors. Changing the rules for assessing prosecutors. Increasing the control function of the Sejm in the implementation of penal policy. Providing assistance to crime victims after the trial. Today, especially adults, are left to their own devices. Ensuring effective law enforcement. The lack of a law enforcement system is visible, for example, in relation to fathers who cannot enforce from their former partners the rules of visitation with the child, which were specified in the court decision. Consideration of restoring the so-called municipal departments in district courts. Combining minor and serious crime cases within one department does not facilitate the speed of proceedings and causes experienced judges to receive - in the order in which they are received - trivial cases. ADMINISTRATION Administration should serve citizens. Every citizen must be treated subjectively in the office. The target situation is a situation in which a citizen does not have to visit the office because he can handle all his affairs via the Internet. Offices must be accessible and citizen-friendly, and information about their activities must be fully public. Moving a large part of central offices outside Warsaw. One way to achieve sustainable regional development is to deconcentrate central offices. Such a model operates successfully in Germany. The deconcentration of offices is associated with the development of the transport and telecommunications network between the new centers of central power and the capital. This will influence the development of regions and improve the quality of life outside Warsaw. Computerization of public administration. Full computerization of public administration is a historical necessity. In the era of universal access to the Internet, it should be a standard that every citizen can handle all official matters without leaving home. Limiting the outsourcing of public services. Public administration cannot operate like a private enterprise and be focused only on reducing the costs of its operations. It is equally important to ensure that all its activities are consistent with the public interest and serve to achieve social goals that go beyond the tasks performed by individual administration bodies. For these reasons, we believe that it is necessary to limit the possibility of delegating public tasks to private entities. Experience shows that they

and introducing regulations regulating land trade and preventing its uncontrolled purchase by foreign entities. The Agricultural Property Agency should pursue a policy of giving land to farmers and agricultural cooperatives on a long-term lease to strengthen the Polish production potential. Creation of one food safety agency – one institution instead of five. We also propose a combination of inspections to ensure food safety. Currently, inspections in this area are carried out by five state inspections, i.e. Verructual Inspections. These are the veterinary organs, the State Plant Health and Seed Inspection, the Trade Quality Inspection of Agricultural and Food Products, which are subordinated to the Minister of Agriculture, as well as the Trade Inspection, which is within the structures of the Office of Competition and Consumer Protection, and the State Sanitary Inspection, which is subordinate to the Minister of Health. Restoration of structural pensions. It is a tool that helps improve the agrarian structure. Structural pensions should be complemented by support for young farmers who want to develop production on their farms. Universal agricultural insurance system. Creation of a truly universal agricultural production insurance system against all risks, supported by subsidies from the state budget. Allocating funds from cohesion policy to improve the quality of life of residents of rural areas. Funds from the Rural Development Program are used to develop transport, educational, health, cultural and sports infrastructure in rural areas. By 2020, funds from cohesion policy should also be allocated for this purpose. JUSTICE The justice system only works efficiently when all parties are equal. When everyone - regardless of wealth - can use the help of a qualified lawyer. When everyone - regardless of where they live - has access to a court located nearby. In a democratic country, justice is for everyone, not just the rich. Creation of a system of free legal assistance. We propose to base the system of free legal assistance on a system of tenders in which law firms, as well as non-governmental organizations and university legal clinics could participate. Transferring divorce cases to district courts. Facilitating access to the court for people from smaller towns. Restoration of labor and social security departments in district courts. During the eight years of rule of the PO-PSL coalition, the labor and social security departments were gradually liquidated. Labor courts also fell victim to the liquidation of several dozen district courts by Minister Gowin. The reform was reversed, but labor and social security departments were not restored in many cities. Access to labor courts close to home is a guarantee of effective enforcement of employee rights. The profession of a judge is the crown of the legal profession. Possibility to become a judge after five years of practicing other legal professions. Reinforcing the judiciary with people with practical legal experience. Reducing the time of court proceedings. This will be possible by simplifying the method of preparing justifications for judgments, reform of the court expert system and introducing the rule that judges are guided primarily by profit and,

and kindergarten. Children cannot leave school or kindergarten hungry. Full-day care for students at schools in school clubs. A full-fledged school is one that provides children with care during parents' working hours. Restoring the appropriate rank of probation officers' pedagogical supervision. School boards should once again become an institution that cares about the quality of teaching in schools, regardless of the status of their governing body SCIENCE Poland is threatened with a development drift trap. We can only avoid it if we invest in scientific research that will increase the innovativeness of our economy. When Poland becomes a country of innovative industry, the earnings of employees throughout the economy will increase. Allocating 60% of GDP growth per year to research, development and investments in science. Possibility to donate one percent of CIT to a selected scientific institution. This will encourage companies to invest in science. Permanent, stable high financing of science from the state budget. High statutory subsidies as the basis for financing the salaries of employees, as well as other educational expenses (research trips, conference trips, etc.). Scientific and research grants should only be an additional source of income, and not the main one as currently. Preventing wasteful employment of research workers. Contributing to making science funnier are, among others: grants as the basis for contracts for specific work, mandate contracts and fixed-term contracts. Junk contracts in the science sector mean not only job instability, but also a deterioration in the quality of scientific research. Permanent employment is the basis for high quality and continuity of scientific research. Liquidation of habilitation. Lifting the barrier blocking the careers of young scientists. Stopping the exploitation of doctoral students and junior researchers. Such exploitation is facilitated by the points and grant system: young researchers work for points and under grants supervised by senior scientists. Financial exploitation is accompanied by unequal access to benefits related to managing grants. Support for cooperation between industry and science. Creation of an institution financing science, taking into account the needs of industry and investment financing from the European Union. Sustainable development of the world of science. Supporting smaller research centers as an investment in the labor market and development of a given region. Increasing funding for the humanities. Changing the system of financing the humanities: awards instead of grants. The humanities cannot be treated as a second-class science. FLATS The state should pursue an active housing policy. It is the best flywheel of the entire economy. We know how to provide poor Poles with access to housing, while stimulating economic development. National housing construction program. We propose a national housing construction program financed through the National Economy Bank thanks to the so-called mechanism. quantitative easing of the National Bank of Poland. The central bank would lend commercial banks (taking advantage of its privileged position) funds dedicated to housing construction. These funds could be borrowed by local governments to build apartments for rent. Increasing the number of apartments for rent. Introduction of a tax relief related to apartment

At the same time, citizens will be sure that they will find everything in one place. #The network will enforce the principle that all meetings of public authorities are public and will limit the possibility of withholding information from the public. Non-publicity will be the exception to the rule, not the other way around. At the same time, the basic rules of public participation in decision-making will be enshrined in the constitution. The proposal will also include the possibility of a legislative initiative for citizens, when the NR SR will have to negotiate a law that will be signed by at least 50,000 citizens. #The network will fundamentally strengthen the government's transparency towards municipalities, but also within the municipality itself. We will enforce the strengthening of claimable and transparently distributed resources for self-government in exchange for the fact that municipalities take over the so-called kindergarten guarantee. However, we will also enforce the tying of the remaining state aid to local governments, including European funds, for the introduction of measures modeled on the Transparent City project, which was introduced in Martin by Andrej Hrnčiar in cooperation with Transparency International Slovakia. We will leave the self-government free in what set of measures it chooses, but we will condition the state's financial aid on obtaining a certain number of points in the transparency evaluation, which will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance. #The network will enforce a new law on public procurement, the aim of which will be easier, faster and more efficient purchases with our common money. #In it, the Network will enforce the strengthening of competition so that it is not possible to announce procurements tailored to one bidder and will increase the responsibility of the procuring entity for the outcome of the procurement within the framework of the already mentioned rule of good stewardship. #The Network will unblock large procurements, through which the largest part of public funds pass, by proposing to introduce a special body staffed by international experts to supervise large procurements (above 10 million euros) with a clear decision-making schedule and the final word. #The network will also push for strengthening the power of procuring agents against fraudsters and low-quality suppliers and making the law more flexible for small procurers and small contracts, including support for local suppliers. until 2020 #The network will adopt a new law on the civil service, which will ensure a clear and realistic separation of political and bureaucratic levels in the civil service. In the case of political nominees, there should be clear political responsibility (appointment by a specific minister), a high degree of transparency about the terms of employment (what salary and for what) and clear rules regarding conflicts of interest (property declarations, independent review). In the case of choosing career officials, we should be inspired by the model used by the European Commission. Within this model, there will be a uniform list of people who have met the qualitative

Republic per year will be dedicated only to simplifying legislation. We will enforce a reduction in the levy burden by 500 euros for each employee and SZČO, up to a saving of 25,000 euros per year. We will prevent the repetition of fraudulent restructurings and the abuse of bankruptcies. The debtor's ability to propose a restructuring administrator will be removed, and box companies will automatically be considered related parties to the debtor. within two years #The network will support artisans and farmers by substantially increasing the limit on flat-rate expenses. We will enforce the One Meter measure, which will mean a balance in the relationship between the taxpayer and the state. By using the one meter rule, they achieve, for example, that if the state illegally does not refund the VAT deductions to the entrepreneur, the entrepreneur must get them back with interest. We will adopt a new law on public procurement, the aim of which will be easier, faster and more efficient purchases with our common money. until 2020 We will simplify the tax system. We will reduce the number of VAT rates and exemptions and remove anomalies where, for example, a self-employed person pays a higher rate of income tax than a large business. We will unify the collection of taxes and social contributions into a unified system and prepare the abolition of health contributions. For small entrepreneurs with a turnover of up to EUR 20,000, the #Network will offer a voluntary One Payment system, which will replace all levy and tax obligations and communication with the authorities. We will introduce a set of measures that will reduce bureaucracy. The One Stamp measure guarantees that it is possible to start a business in one day and it can be handled in one place. With the One Office measure, we will ensure the availability of the services of the most used offices under one roof in each district. We will also promote accelerated electronicization of the state administration. If the state administration has already requested certain information from a citizen, it may not request it again. We will create legislative and fiscal conditions for increasing the share of Slovak food on the domestic market to 80 percent, and we will enable the use of home-made food, organic food and ingredients in the preparation of food in restaurants and other establishments from small regional farms and from home production, thereby supporting local farmers. employees The first 100 days We will enforce the constitutional protection of the percentage of levies going to the 2nd pillar, so that governments cannot change them at will, but also solidarity in the form of a minimum pension and the freedom to dispose of the saved funds. We will eliminate discrimination against savers, whose pensions from the first pillar are cut by the state much more than they should. We will simplify the tax system and lower income tax for all working families. We believe that money should be left in the families who know best

network will develop a new defense strategy of the Slovak Republic. It is crucial that our strategies and plans are kept up to date and harmonized with those of allies at regular intervals. We see the solution in establishing a mechanism that will ensure the systematic submission and approval of strategic documents and modernization plans at all levels. within two years The #Network will strive to fulfill Slovakia's commitment to stop the decline in defense spending, to ensure their real increase in line with economic growth, and to allocate a share of GDP to defense in accordance with accepted international obligations by 2020. At the same time, we intend to spend 20% of the total defense expenditure on the modernization of the armed forces. For the continued transformation of the armed forces, we need sufficient resources, but also to achieve a balanced structure of defense spending. The reform cannot take place at the expense of staffing units, adequate training and modern infrastructure. #The network will harmonize and simplify defense laws. The retroactivity of the laws and the worsening of the social security conditions of professional soldiers in relation to the current situation are unacceptable. #The network will practice a new approach to defense planning that is comprehensive in nature and harmonized with NATO processes. We see the solution in a draft law that will establish the details of defense planning binding on all relevant branches of the state. #The network wants to revive the domestic defense industry. We will therefore support the processing of the state strategy for the development of the Slovak defense industrial and technological base. The presence of a viable defense industry on the territory of the state increases its defense capability. We see the solution in reviving domestic defense research and development by ramping up domestic production of weapons and military technology, thereby creating new job opportunities for our citizens. In order to fulfill transparency, legitimacy, economy and control, the #Network will ensure that public procurement is based exclusively on approved and financially secured defense development plans. Public procurement in recent years has been accompanied by several cases. Almost all major defense projects have been subject to long delays and cost overruns. until 2020 #The Network supports Slovakia's commitments to comply with the individual and collective ability to resist an armed attack. In accordance with Article 3 of the Washington Treaty, Slovakia will maintain and develop its individual and collective ability to resist an armed attack. In order to fulfill the tasks of defending the state with its own forces or with allies within the framework of collective defense, it is necessary to continue to maintain and develop a single package of flexible and resource-achievable defense capabilities with a corresponding command and control system, compatible with NATO allied force structures. The development of forces and capabilities destined for collective defense according to Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty must become the core of the further qualitative transformation of our armed forces. #The network is aware

We will promote the deployment of public administration bodies across Slovakia. In this way, we will contribute to a fairer distribution of opportunities between the regions to enable them to participate in the common work. We will introduce a system of regional state secretaries of ministries. We will push for ten state secretaries to serve in different cities of Slovakia. We will also support the participation of the regions in the creation of national measures by introducing rules for the organization of out-of-town meetings of the government. They will be held eight times a year, every six weeks in a different self-governing region. within two years #The network will change the electoral system so that multiple constituencies are introduced. Today, citizens from the regions pay extra for one electoral district because Bratislava is overrepresented in the parliament and there is no territorial connection between the voter and the MP. When deputies are elected in the regions, they will be motivated to work for the benefit of the citizens of their district. The second change is accountability during the election period. It is not enough to ask for a mandate once every four years and then rule undisturbed. Voters should be able to say what they think about the performance of their representatives during the election period. As they do in the case of impeachable mayors. #The network will strengthen the role of municipalities and regions in making decisions about public services by further decentralizing them. However, this requires the reorganization of the local government so that it is able to fulfill these tasks. #The network unites the Bratislava VÚC and the capital city of Bratislava following the example of Prague or Vienna. #The network will create legislative and fiscal conditions for increasing the share of Slovak food on the domestic market to 80 percent and we will enable the use of home-grown food, BIO-food and ingredients in the preparation of food in restaurants and other establishments from small regional farms and from home production, thus supporting local farmers. Currently, yard sales are only possible for end consumers. In the European Union, it is common for restaurants to cook from local ingredients. So we will abolish legislation in the field of hygiene requirements and other bureaucracy so that it does not go beyond the obligations set by the EU. until 2020 To improve life in the regions, the #Network will prepare the conditions for building bypasses of traffic-congested settlements, will improve public transport connections in remote regions, will support the building of local and regional cycling routes, water supply and sewerage. A big problem for the regions is the road infrastructure. People in the regions are not interested in welfare packages or economic statistics. Only if highways, feeders

from such an activity, which will not be subject to taxation or levy obligations (the parent would not be forced to start a business, for example), should not exceed €3,000. At the same time, the parent will not lose child benefits. until 2020 #The network will advocate for equal pension sharing between spouses to be the starting rule when getting married. #The network will arrange for Slovak maternity hospitals to raise their level and provide maternity services to international standards. #The network will advocate for the adoption of comprehensive measures to combat domestic violence. Every woman and her children must find a safe place to escape from domestic violence. They must be provided with professional assistance from the police, courts and social workers, as well as better law enforcement. #The network will provide affordable rental housing in two ways. We will increase the construction of rental apartments by improving the conditions for the wider involvement of non-state actors (churches, non-profit organizations and private individuals) and municipalities in the construction process in cooperation with the state and prevent them from falling out of the housing stock. The goal is to ensure a many times greater number of rental apartments, which will serve, for example, as so-called "Reflective" housing for young people, or will enable higher labor mobility. We will also tighten the minimum transparency rules for the allocation of rental apartments. As part of the use of the institute, the so-called replacement alimony #The Network will amend the law so that when the debtor pays any amount of missed mandatory alimony to the entitled beneficiary, the latter will not be forced to return this amount to the Labor Office, unless this amount relates to the period in which the beneficiary already used the institution of substitute alimony. This means that the law will clearly determine the period to which the part of the alimony payment in arrears refers. # 3 Helping the regions The first 100 days #The network will limit the provision of all investment incentives in cash form throughout Slovakia. Instead, we will help regional economies through Regional Economic Zones (REZ). REZ will be created in regions with high unemployment. The created economic zones at the district level will have special and blanket tax rules that will be set to attract new investments and create additional jobs even in already existing businesses and operations. The rules will automatically apply to all entities that will invest and employ people in a given REZ. The tool of this special tax policy will be, for example, the so-called faster and higher depreciation ("turbo depreciation") on costs associated with fixed investments and labor costs for the first two years of new operation, as well as costs associated with science and research up to 200%. #The network wants to make a strong REZ with high unemployment and low salaries in the poor regions of Slovakia.
