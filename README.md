# Manisiesta

## Description
Using several features of a country, the goal is to determine whether there is a connection between these features and the gini coëfficient, a measurement of inequality. The features used are the rile score, the political orientation of the leading party, social welfare spending, level of democracy, GNI, with a main focus on the stance positivity score calculated using the Manifestoberta data.

Because of the varying definitions of conservatism and liberalism in geographical areas, there is a focus on Europe. 
Because of possible major shifts between left and right / conservatism and liberalism in certain time periods, the initial research is focused on a time period: 2005-2020.

This research is done through a linear (?) regression model.
